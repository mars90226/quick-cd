QUICK CD

This small command-line tool can help you quickly change directory to what you want with few keystrokes.

Here's a example: You want to quickly switch to "C:\Documents and Settings"

1. You need to add the directory first, so you can navigate it later on. Cd to that directory and type `qcd -a document`. This will add the current directory with a name _document_.
2. Then you can use `qcd document` to quickly change directory that directory.
